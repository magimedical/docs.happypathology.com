Welcome to the HappyPathology API!

This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need:

- A signing key pair
- Have a basic understanding of REST APIs and how to make HTTP requests including setting headers
- A basic understanding of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and how to sign them
- A secure way to store your private key and access them from your application


## Recommended tools

### Making HTTP calls
To manually make API requests and experiment with the API, we recommend using one of the following tools:

- Insomnia: [https://insomnia.rest/](https://insomnia.rest/)
- Bruno [https://www.usebruno.com/](https://www.usebruno.com/)
- Curlie [https://curlie.dev/](https://curlie.dev/)

#### Working with JWTs
To manually create or view and validate JWTs, we recommend using one of the following tools:

- JWT.io: [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)

You also need to use a JWT library, you can find a list of them in any language you work in here:

- JWT Libraries: [https://www.jwt.io/libraries](https://www.jwt.io/libraries)
